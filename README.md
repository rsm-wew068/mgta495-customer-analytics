# Customer Analytics Case Studies

This repository contains a collection of advanced business analytics case studies, each designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world data, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision making. The cases are implemented as Jupyter notebooks and cover a range of modeling techniques and business problems.
